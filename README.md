# Reef Brite App Landing Page

This repository contains the code for the Reef Brite App landing page. This landing page automatically redirects visitors to the appropriate app store based on their device's operating system (iOS or Android). If the device's operating system is not recognized, the page displays download links for both app stores.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file, `index.html`, which includes the necessary JavaScript to detect the visitor's operating system and perform the redirection or display the appropriate download links.

It also includes the Reef Brite logo, as well as images for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace the image paths in the `index.html` with the actual URLs of your App Store, Google Play Store images, and logo. You will find placeholders in the code which look like this: `path-to-appstore-image.jpg`, `path-to-playstore-image.jpg` and `path-to-your-logo.png`.
3. Publish the webpage online. You can use services like GitHub Pages for free hosting.

## Generating a QR Code

You can use a free online QR code generator to create a QR code that links to the URL where you host this landing page. This QR code can be scanned by a user's device and they will be directed to the appropriate app store.

Please note, the longevity of a QR code is indefinite. However, it's essential that the webpage it links to remains active for the QR code to work.
